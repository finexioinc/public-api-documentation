Make API specification documentation changes in the /output/v0.0.json.

Once a PR is created, reviewed, and merged to the "main" branch the changes will be deployed to the "staging" API documentation version v0.0 on the Finexio Readme.com account.

You can also run the included Node project locally where you can access a Redoc hosted version of the v0.0 documentation at http://localhost:3002/

Viewing the documentation locally makes validation of the formatting of the JSON specification much easier.
